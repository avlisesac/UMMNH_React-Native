	shortDescription: `Our <i>Evolution: Life Through Time</i> exhibit will take you in order from the oldest known living things all the way to the modern day. Along the way you will learn about the ups and downs of life on our shared planet, then and now. You will see some unusual specimens and have the opportunity to interact with some of the displays. Keep an eye out for the “Please Touch” signs!`,
	fullDescription: 
	`From the first single-celled organisms to modern plants and animals, modern evolutionary theory can explain how the incredible diversity of living things evolved from a single ancient ancestor. Our gallery will guide you chronologically from the earliest life on the planet to life today.

Along the way, use the white geometric “clouds” that hang from the ceiling as waypoints to different time periods, and learn about what makes each chapter of life’s story unique.

Use the Extinction Pillars to learn about the five mass extinctions that have already occurred in Earth’s history, as well as what might be causing the next one.

At the end of the gallery, be sure to stop at the last Extinction Pillar to learn about how you and your community can help prevent the next big die-off.

There are more stops on our tour in the <i>Evolution: Life Through Time</i> gallery, so don’t rush ahead!`,
	
	TLAS_Q1: `Q. Using the scorch-marks as a guide, which of Earth’s 5 Mass Extinctions had the most loss of species?`,
	TLAS_Q2: `Q. When did the largest animals of all time live?`,
	TLAS_Q3: `Q. How many of the ways to help combat climate change at the end of the Evolution gallery do you or your family already do? Which ones do you think you’d like to try?`,
	TLAS_A1: `A. The largest Mass Extinction in Earth’s history was the third, occurring about 252 million years ago. During this Mass Extinction, Earth lost between 80 and 90 percent of it’s biodiversity!`,
	TLAS_A2: `A. Right now! The Blue Whale is the largest animal that scientists have ever found. But outside of the ocean, the Cretaceous Period had the largest animals that ever flew or walked on land.`,
	TLAS_A3: `A. This one will be different for everybody, but every step you take makes a difference! Take note of some of these suggestions and try them yourself!`,
