	fullDescription: 
`The Fossil Prep Lab (our nickname for the Vertebrate Fossil Preparation Laboratory) is where Museum of Paleontology staff, students, and volunteers extract fossils from rock and then clean and stabilize them in preparation for study and display. A lot of careful work goes into the preparation of often delicate fossils, and this is where it gets done.

During and after excavation in the field, scientists may cover specimens in layers of protective material, usually plaster and burlap. Back at the lab, this “jacket” is removed to continue the fossil preparation. To expose the fossil, preparators use a variety of tools to meticulously remove rock and sediment. 

When the fossil is ready, we sometimes create a mold. To do this, the fossil is sectioned off with clay divisions and coated with a molding material, usually silicone molding rubber. When all parts of the fossil have molds created, the mold is put together and filled with a casting material to create a final fossil cast.`,

	TLAS_Q3: 'Q: Do you want to learn more about the goings on in the lab?',
	TLAS_A1: "A: These large tubes are actually vents that help extract dust and sediment from the room. A clean work space is necessary for effective fossil preparation.",
	TLAS_A2: "A: If you need help with what they look like, check the sign in front of the window.",
	TLAS_A3: "A: Press the button on the sign! If there’s a scientist in the lab, they can answer your questions!",
